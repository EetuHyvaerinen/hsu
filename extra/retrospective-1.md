# Retrospective for Iteration 1

The general feeling is that we did pretty well completing our goals for this iteration.
There was some confusion during this iteration about how the Rational Unified Process works and how to get started on the project,
but that was overcome by working together and strong communication.

## What we did well

- We communicated a lot
- We all were able to contribute something
- We made quite a few unit tests, adding to the stability of our project
- The art work, mostly done by Johni, looks great so far


## What we can do better

- Work was done without tasks being assigned, leading to confusion 
- We planned a few too many things and underestimated the amount of work entailed
- We had some miss-communication around responsibilities and vision of the project
- Some members spent a lot of time feeling lost, not knowing where or how to contribute

## Actions we can take

- Better documentation and communication about the documentation
- Focus work on iteration tasks, make sure iteration task align with vision document
- Create more wiggle room in estimates. Estimation is a dark art, but we can add more padding
