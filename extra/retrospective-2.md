# Retrospective for Iteration 2

This iteration was a struggle because many of us had term papers and presentations due.
Still, despite having somewhat reduced focus,
the general perspective is that we did pretty good hitting our goals,
although we are looking to improve next sprint.

## What we did well

- Better estimation of tasks, even if we still fell short
- Better documentation, intro into the project itself and a guide to contributing
- More tests, adding even more checks and balances
- More pair-programming that helped us share knowledge

## What we can do better

- We lost focus of our Minimum Viable Product some and investigated features that we were not ready for
- There wasn't as much communication as there could have been, some team members felt out of the loop
- Unfortunately, our code coverage declined some during this sprint
- "Multiple-clocks"

## Actions we can take

- Check in with the team at least twice a week, even if you're busy 
- Test each others' cards and verify that there are new tests if appropriate
- As an increasing percentage of our code is UI focused, we should make testing that code easier
